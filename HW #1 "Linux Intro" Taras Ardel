1. Create `cursor` directory and `test.txt` file
  mkdir cursor
  touch test.txt


2. Copy `test.txt` file to `cursor` directory
  cp test.txt cursor

3. List the files in the current directory, in “long listing format”.
  ls -l

4. List all files, including hidden files, in the your home (~) directory, in reverse alphabetical order and long listing format.
  ls -la -r ~

5*. Rename the file `test.txt` to `new_test.txt` and then create one more `empty_file.txt`
Hint: Renaming is done using the same command as moving.
  mv test.txt new_test.txt
  touch empty_file.txt

6. Delete the files empty_file.txt and new_test.txt. Note that your answer must be a single command and not multiple commands.
Hint: Many commands can accept more than one parameter.
  rm empty_file.txt new_test.txt

Create hw.txt file under cursor directory
  touch hw.txt

7*. Set the file hw.txt to have a last-modified date of January 1, 2020, 4:15am.
Hint: The man page for the proper command describes the timestamp 'STAMP' format to use. Look for this!
Also note: Linux is case-sensitive when you are specifying file or directory names.
You can use a * (asterisk) as a “wild-card” character to specify a group of files.
For example, *foo means all files whose names end with foo, and foo* means all files whose names begin with foo.
You can use a wildcard in the middle of a file name, such as foo*bar for all files that start with foo and end with bar.
  touch -t 202001010415.00 hw.txt

Create hw.sh, hw1.sh, hw2.sh, hw1.txt under the cursor directory
  touch hw.sh, hw1.sh, hw2.sh, hw1.txt

8. List all files (only with the extension .sh) in the current directory.
Note that the ls command can accept more than one parameter for what files you want it to list.
Hint: Use grep
  ls | grep .sh

9. Copy all the text files (files whose names end with .txt) from the current folder to the new directory `text_files`.
  mkdir text_files | cp *.txt text_files

10. Write `cursor` to the hw.txt file by using echo.
  sudo echo 'cursor' >> hw.txt

11. Display the contents of hw.txt
  cat hw.txt

12. Change the permissions to 0 for current user and try to Display contents again.
  chmod 0 hw.txt
  sudo cat hw.txt

13. Change the permission to rwx for current user only and try again.
  chmod 700 hw.txt
  cat hw.txt

14. Write from 1 to 10 in each line in hw.txt by using text reader.
  vi hw.txt
  Press A
  enter from 1 to 10 in each line
  Press esc
  :wq

🔍 Self Discovery: The head and tail commands output only the first or last few lines (respectively) of a file to the terminal.

15. Display only the first 7 lines of the file hw.txt from the current directory on the terminal.
  cat -n hw.txt | more -7
  more -n 7 hw.txt
  head -n 7 hw.txt

16*. Create test.sh with echo 'Hello' and make it executable
  touch test.sh | echo 'echo Hello' >> test.sh | chmod 760 test.sh

17*. Execute test.sh
  ./test.sh

18. Search for a files with .sh in your working directory.
  find *.sh
